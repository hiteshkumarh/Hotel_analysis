## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **hospitality analytics** to analyze hotel booking data and uncover the **drivers of revenue decline**.  
By performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, the project highlights critical insights into **occupancy rates, booking platforms, and customer reviews**—empowering hotels to make **data-driven business decisions**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Detect **revenue decline patterns** using occupancy & seasonality trends.  
- Assess how **booking platforms** (OTAs vs direct) affect revenue stability.  
- Examine the impact of **customer reviews & sentiment** on bookings.  
- Build a **streamlined pipeline** to reduce processing time and improve accuracy.
