Hotel Booking Revenue Analysis










📌 Project Overview

This project applies hospitality analytics to analyze hotel booking data and uncover the drivers of revenue decline. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project highlights critical insights into occupancy rates, booking platforms, and customer reviews—empowering hotels to make data-driven business decisions.

🎯 Objectives

Detect revenue decline patterns using occupancy & seasonality trends.

Assess how booking platforms (OTAs vs direct) affect revenue stability.

Examine the impact of customer reviews & sentiment on bookings.

Build a streamlined pipeline to reduce processing time and improve accuracy.
